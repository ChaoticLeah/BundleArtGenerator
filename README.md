I made this generator for the new minecraft snapshots, I hope you will find it useful.

Features:

- A full on graphical editor
- A Command Generator ready for command blocks!
- Support for 8x8 & 16x16 pixel art
- All the colors supported by minecraft stained glass
- Just like any other pixel art program!
